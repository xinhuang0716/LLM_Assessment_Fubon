    "question": "where is the brain located in a human body",
    "reference_answer": "Human brain The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head. The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes â€“ the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.",
    "model_answer": "The brain is located in the head, specifically within the cranial cavity of the skull. It is protected by the skull bones and surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions it from impact and provides nutrients [1], [2].

Robinson was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era for being a member of the Communist Party. He also wrote campaign songs for the presidential campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace, and, in 1984, Jesse Jackson. The lyrics were written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol[4] under the pen name Lewis Allan. In 1957 Meeropol adopted two boys, Michael and Robert, who had been orphaned when their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953.[4] Meeropol was enraged that the second verse of the song was not used in the film. When the film premiered, he protested against the deletion of the verse referring to \"my neighbors white and black\".",

Among the audience are the Royal Family, invited guests, ticket holders and the general public. The ceremony is broadcast live by the BBC within the UK and is also shown in Germany and Belgium, and since 2018, has been streamed online to viewers all over the world, via the Time magazine YouTube channel and the Facebook page of the British newspaper The Telegraph, with the Associated Press providing live video coverage of the event.",
    "model_answer": "The Trooping of the Colour is a ceremonial event held annually in the United Kingdom to celebrate the official birthday of the British monarch. Invitations to the event are extended to specific groups and individuals, including:\n\n1. **Members of the Royal Family**: Senior and working members of the British Royal Family are typically invited to attend and participate in the ceremony. They often appear on horseback or in carriages during the parade and later gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the Royal Air Force flypast [1].\n\n2. **Government Officials and Dignitaries**: High-ranking government officials, including the Prime Minister, members of Parliament, and other dignitaries, are invited to attend as part of the formal celebration of the monarchy and its role in the UK government [2].\n\n3. **Military Personnel**: The event is a military ceremony, so it involves and honors members of the British Armed Forces. Specific regiments participate in the parade, and other military personnel may attend as guests [3].\n\n4. **Public Ticket Holders**: A limited number of tickets are made available to the public through an application process. These tickets allow civilians to view the parade from designated areas, such as the Horse Guards Parade in London [4].\n\n5. **Foreign Diplomats and Guests**: Diplomats from other countries and select foreign dignitaries may also be invited to attend as part of international relations and goodwill [5].",

    "reference_answer": "Garden of Eden Although the Garden of Eden is considered to be mythological by most scholars,[19][20][21][22][23][24] there have been other suggestions for its location:[25] for example, at the head of the Persian Gulf, in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea;[26] and in the Armenian Highlands or Armenian Plateau.[27][28][29][30] British archaeologist David Rohl claims it may have been located in Iran, and in the vicinity of Tabriz, but this suggestion has not caught on with scholarly sources.[31]",
    "model_answer": "The exact location of the Garden of Eden is not definitively known, and its existence is often considered symbolic or theological rather than geographical. However, various interpretations and theories suggest potential locations based on biblical descriptions and historical geography:\n\n1. **Mesopotamia (Modern-Day Iraq)**: The Bible describes the Garden of Eden as being near four rivers: the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris (Hiddekel), and Euphrates (Genesis 2:10-14). The Tigris and Euphrates are real rivers located in modern-day Iraq, leading many scholars to associate the Garden of Eden with Mesopotamia, often referred to as the \"Cradle of Civilization\" [1].\n\n2. **Persian Gulf Region**: Some researchers suggest that the Garden of Eden could have been located in the area now submerged under the Persian Gulf. This theory is based on geological evidence of a fertile landmass that existed in the region during the last Ice Age, which aligns with the description of Eden as a lush and fertile place [2].\n\n3. **Armenian Highlands (Eastern Turkey)**: Another theory places Eden in the Armenian Highlands, near the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This area is geographically consistent with the biblical description of rivers flowing out of Eden [3].\n\n4. **Symbolic Interpretation**: Many theologians and scholars argue that the Garden of Eden is not a physical location but a symbolic or allegorical concept representing a state of harmony between humanity and God [4].\n\nIn conclusion, while there are various theories about the Garden of Eden's location, there is no definitive evidence to confirm its existence or precise location in the modern world.",

    "model_answer": "An **endothermic reaction** is a chemical reaction that absorbs energy, usually in the form of heat, from its surroundings. This results in a decrease in the temperature of the surroundings because the reaction requires energy input to proceed. Examples include photosynthesis and the melting of ice [1], [2].\n\nAn **exothermic reaction**, on the other hand, is a chemical reaction that releases energy, often in the form of heat, light, or sound, to its surroundings. This causes an increase in the temperature of the surroundings. Examples include combustion and the condensation of water vapor [1], [3].\n\nThe key difference between the two is the direction of energy flow: endothermic reactions absorb energy, while exothermic reactions release energy [1].",

In 2015 a radical new shelter called the Navigation Center was created to addressed these issues. [12]",

The second branch (known as the ductus venosus) bypasses the liver and flows into the inferior vena cava, which carries blood towards the heart.

While transporting a package across the Mojave Desert to the city of New Vegas, the Courier is ambushed, robbed of the package, shot in the head, and left for dead. After surviving, the Courier begins a journey to find their would-be killer and recover the package, makes friends and enemies among various factions, and ultimately becomes caught up in a conflict that determines who will control New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland. New Vegas received positive reviews, with reviewers praising the game's writing, quests, and improved gameplay, while garnering criticism for glitches and bugs on launch. New Vegas was a commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether, and is estimated to have sold around 12 million copies worldwide. It also received a Golden Joystick Award for \"RPG of the Year\" in 2011.",

The film stars Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, and Dan Aykroyd. Freeman reprised his role from the Original Off-Broadway production. The story defines Daisy and her point of view through a network of relationships and emotions by focusing on her home life, synagogue, friends, family, fears, and concerns over a 25-year period.",
    "model_answer": "The term \"Driving Miss Daisy\" originates from the title of a Pulitzer Prize-winning play written by Alfred Uhry in 1987, which was later adapted into a popular film in 1989. The story revolves around the relationship between an elderly Jewish woman, Daisy Werthan, and her African-American chauffeur, Hoke Colburn, in the American South during the mid-20th century. The title refers to the literal act of Hoke driving Daisy around, but it also symbolizes the evolving dynamics of their relationship, which grows from employer-employee to a deep friendship despite racial and social barriers of the time [1][2][3].\n\nThe phrase has since entered popular culture as a metaphor for chauffeuring someone or being in a service role, often with undertones of care or obligation [3].",

    "question": "explain the working principle of optical fiber transmission media",
    "reference_answer": "Optical fiber Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal. Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17 dB/km at 1550 nm.[52] For example, an 8 km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550 nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see all the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.[53]",
    "model_answer": "Optical fiber transmission media work on the principle of **total internal reflection**, which allows light signals to propagate through the fiber core with minimal loss. The key components and principles involved are as follows:\n\n1. **Core and Cladding Structure**: Optical fibers consist of a central core (made of glass or plastic) surrounded by a cladding layer with a lower refractive index. The difference in refractive indices between the core and cladding ensures that light entering the core at a certain angle is reflected back into the core rather than escaping [1].\n\n2. **Total Internal Reflection**: When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (core) to a medium with a lower refractive index (cladding) at an angle greater than the critical angle, it undergoes total internal reflection. This phenomenon keeps the light confined within the core and allows it to travel long distances with minimal attenuation [2].\n\n3. **Light Signal Transmission**: Information is transmitted through the fiber in the form of light pulses, which represent binary data (1s and 0s). A light source, such as a laser or LED, generates these pulses, which are then modulated to encode the data. The light travels through the fiber, bouncing off the core-cladding boundary due to total internal reflection [3].\n\n4. **Low Attenuation and High Bandwidth**: Optical fibers have very low signal loss and can support high data transmission rates over long distances. This makes them ideal for telecommunications, internet, and other high-speed data applications [3].\n\n5. **Advantages of Optical Fibers**: Compared to traditional copper cables, optical fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, have higher bandwidth capabilities, and are lighter and more durable [3].",

Struggling from a lack of customers, Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) decides to close the store, but Audrey suggests he may have more success by displaying an unusual plant that Seymour owns. Immediately attracting a customer, Seymour explains he bought the plant, which he dubbed \"Audrey II\", from a Chinese flower shop during a solar eclipse (\"Da-Doo\").

    "reference_answer": "Electrical conduction system of the heart The AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system. Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn't flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles. The delay in the AV node forms much of the PR segment on the ECG, and part of atrial repolarization can be represented by PR segment.",
    "model_answer": "The AV nodal delay is represented in the **PR interval** of the ECG. Specifically, it corresponds to the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria through the atrioventricular (AV) node and into the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have enough time to contract and fully empty their blood into the ventricles before ventricular contraction begins [1], [2], [3].",
