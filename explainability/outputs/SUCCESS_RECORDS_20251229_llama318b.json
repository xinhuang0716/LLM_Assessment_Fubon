    "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nThere are 300 cows in total because 300 = <<300=300>>300\nTwice as many females as males means that if there are x males, then there are 2x females. Since we don't know how many males or females there are yet, let's call the number of males \"m\" and the number of females \"f\". We can write an equation: m + f = 300\nSince there are twice as many females as males, we can also write another equation: f = 2m\nWe can substitute this second equation into the first one to get: m + 2m = 300\nCombining like terms gives us: 3m = 300\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us: m = 100\nNow that we know there are 100 males, we can find out how many females there are using our second equation: f = 2m = 2(100) = <<200=200>>200\nHalf the females have spots, so the number of females with spots is half of 200: 200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100\nHalf the males have horns, so the number of males with horns is half of 100: 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50\nTo find out how many more females with spots there are than males with horns, we subtract the number of males with horns from the number of females with spots: 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50\n\n#### 50",

    "question": "where is the brain located in a human body",
    "reference_answer": "Human brain The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head. The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes â€“ the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.",

Robinson was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era for being a member of the Communist Party. He also wrote campaign songs for the presidential campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace, and, in 1984, Jesse Jackson. The lyrics were written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol[4] under the pen name Lewis Allan. In 1957 Meeropol adopted two boys, Michael and Robert, who had been orphaned when their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953.[4] Meeropol was enraged that the second verse of the song was not used in the film. When the film premiered, he protested against the deletion of the verse referring to \"my neighbors white and black\".",

The Mustangs' engines, brakes and suspensions were heavily modified for the chase by veteran car racer Max Balchowsky. Ford also originally lent two Galaxie sedans for the chase scenes, but the producers found the cars too heavy for the jumps over the hills of San Francisco.

In 2015 a radical new shelter called the Navigation Center was created to addressed these issues. [12]",
    "model_answer": "San Francisco spends a significant amount of money on addressing homelessness, with various estimates and allocations throughout the years. According to the 2020-2021 Budget Document from the City and County of San Francisco [1], the city allocated $286 million for homeless services, which includes funding for housing programs, emergency shelters, and outreach services.\n\nIn addition, a report by the San Francisco Chronicle in 2022 estimated that the city's annual spending on homelessness has been around $400-500 million per year over the past few years [2]. This estimate is based on data from various city departments and agencies, including the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing.\n\nIt's worth noting that these figures may not capture the full scope of San Francisco's expenditures on homelessness, as they may not include funding from other sources or initiatives. However, they do provide a general idea of the significant investments being made by the city to address this complex issue [3].",

    "reference_answer": "Umbilical cord The umbilical cord enters the fetus via the abdomen, at the point which (after separation) will become the umbilicus (or navel). Within the fetus, the umbilical vein continues towards the transverse fissure of the liver, where it splits into two. One of these branches joins with the hepatic portal vein (connecting to its left branch), which carries blood into the liver. The second branch (known as the ductus venosus) bypasses the liver and flows into the inferior vena cava, which carries blood towards the heart. The two umbilical arteries branch from the internal iliac arteries, and pass on either side of the urinary bladder into the umbilical cord, completing the circuit back to the placenta.[6]",

It connects the placenta in the mother's uterus to the fetus, providing essential nutrients and oxygen for growth and development [2].

    "model_answer": "The term \"Driving Miss Daisy\" is derived from a 1948 play by Alfred Uhry, which was later adapted into a film in 1990. The story revolves around the relationship between an elderly Jewish woman named Miss Daisy Werthan and her African American chauffeur, Hoke Colburn.\n\n[1] The play's title refers to the daily routine of driving Miss Daisy around Atlanta, Georgia, where the story takes place. [2] The character of Miss Daisy is based on a real person from Uhry's childhood, who was also named after the flower. [3]",

    "question": "explain the working principle of optical fiber transmission media",
    "reference_answer": "Optical fiber Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal. Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17 dB/km at 1550 nm.[52] For example, an 8 km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550 nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see all the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.[53]",
    "model_answer": "Optical fibers transmit data as light signals through thin glass or plastic fibers. The working principle involves total internal reflection, where a light signal is injected into one end of the fiber and bounces off the core-cladding interface, minimizing signal loss [1]. This phenomenon occurs because the refractive index of the core is higher than that of the cladding [2]. As a result, the light signal remains confined within the core and travels through the fiber with minimal attenuation.",

Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) and his colleague, Audrey (Ellen Greene), work at Mushnik's Flower Shop in a run-down, rough neighborhood referred to as \"Skid Row\" in the slums of New York City. They lament that they cannot escape the neighborhood (\"Skid Row\" (Downtown)\"). Struggling from a lack of customers, Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) decides to close the store, but Audrey suggests he may have more success by displaying an unusual plant that Seymour owns. Immediately attracting a customer, Seymour explains he bought the plant, which he dubbed \"Audrey II\", from a Chinese flower shop during a solar eclipse (\"Da-Doo\"). Attracting business to Mushnik's shop, the plant soon starts dying, worrying Seymour. Accidentally pricking his finger, he then discovers Audrey II needs human blood to thrive (\"Grow For Me\").",

Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn't flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles. The delay in the AV node forms much of the PR segment on the ECG, and part of atrial repolarization can be represented by PR segment.",

The PR interval is the time from the onset of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex, and it represents the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel through the atrioventricular (AV) node [2].
