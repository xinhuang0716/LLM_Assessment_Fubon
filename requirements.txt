# Requirements for Integrated LLM Assessment Framework

# Core dependencies
python>=3.8

# Each module has its own requirements, install them individually:
# - explainability/requirements.txt
# - reliability/ceval/requirements.txt
# - reliability/consistency/requirements.txt
# - safety/pyproject.toml (use uv)

# For running the integrated framework, you'll need:
# 1. Navigate to each module directory and install dependencies
# 2. Run the main.py script from the root directory

# Example installation commands:
# cd explainability && pip install -r requirements.txt
# cd reliability/ceval && pip install -r requirements.txt
# cd reliability/consistency && pip install -r requirements.txt
# cd safety && uv sync
